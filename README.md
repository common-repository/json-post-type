# JSON Post Type

Register a post type for managing arbitrary JSON configurations with an easy WYSIWYG editor.

## Installation

Activate the JSON Post Type plugin on the Plugins page. On activation, there will be a new submenu item called *JSON*. When you add a new JSON, you will see a simplified editor with fields for the title and the JSON itself, which uses JSON Editor (https://github.com/josdejong/jsoneditor) for easy editing.
